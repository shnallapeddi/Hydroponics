### Hydroponics
Hydroponics is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture which involves growing plants, usually crops or medicinal plants, without soil, by using water-based mineral nutrient solutions in an artificial environment.

Built during my B.Tech, this project is an IoT-enabled, closed-loop indoor hydroponics system (hardware setup and circuit diagram included in the attached PDF named 'Equipment/Design'). It processes 1,000+ sensor readings per hour and automates pumps, lighting, and nutrient dosing, cutting water usage by ~50 L per cycle while improving yield uniformity across 200+ plants. I’m now extending it into an AI-driven platform with a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning control loop, using operator feedback for reward shaping to adapt sensor calibration and actuator policies for stable, optimized growth.

Note: This is an ongoing project that I’m actively continuing. Progress videos, results, and the full report will be uploaded/attached soon.
